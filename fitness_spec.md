Product Requirements Document (PRD): Aegis Fitness Tracker
Version: 2.0
Last Updated: August 29, 2025

1. Introduction/Overview
Aegis is a mobile fitness application designed for individuals who want to meticulously track their workout performance and maintain personal accountability over their health goals. Unlike apps focused on social sharing or complex meal-by-meal calorie counting, Aegis focuses on two core areas: detailed logging of weightlifting routines to monitor progressive overload, and simple, daily check-ins for diet, hydration, and body measurements. The app serves as a personal, private digital logbook to empower users with data about their own performance and consistency.

2. Goals/Objectives

Primary Goal: To provide a highly configurable and easy-to-use tool for logging detailed workout information, specifically exercises, sets, target reps, and weight lifted per set.

Secondary Goal: To enable users to track key health metrics (body weight, measurements, diet adherence, water intake, alcohol consumption) with minimal daily effort.

User Experience Goal: To create a clear separation between one-time "setup" (configuration) and daily "action" (tracking) to make the logging process fast and efficient.

Technical Goal: To ensure user data is securely stored locally on the user's device.

3. Target Audience
Individuals who follow a structured weightlifting or fitness plan and are focused on progressive improvement. They are data-oriented and prefer a tool for personal accountability rather than social motivation. They find comprehensive food-logging apps to be too tedious but still want to track their overall dietary consistency.
